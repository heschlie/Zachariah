Zachariah
=========

Zachariah is pre-alpha at the moment.  It will be a side scrolling platformer with some RPG elements to it, if all goes to plan.  This is our first project and is being developed by beginners, so the code may be sloppy but will hopefully work. 

Needed modules:
numpy
pygame
tiledtmxloader
